This Workbook helps you keep track of individual tax lots and calculate your taxes when disposing of taxable assets.

Disclaimer: I am not a tax professional, lawyer, or accountant.  I believe this tool calculates correctly, but it should only be used as an estimation.  Tax rules are confusing and up to interpretation, especially when assigning acquisition methods.  If you don’t have a complete understanding of the tax implications of assigning incorrect acquisition methods, please consult a tax professional.

Each asset has its own Sheet.  To make a new asset, copy the "Template" Sheet.

Each asset Sheet is divided in to 4 sections, “Obtained”, “Dispositions”, “Admin Data”, and a tax section.

“Obtained” contains information on the tax lot you acquire.  “Dispositions” contains data of tax lots you dispose of.  “Admin Data” contains data required to make the Sheet work and can be ignored.  The tax section displays how much tax and of which type is owed for a particular quarter.

Only enter data in the white cells.  Colored cells are for admin data or are calculated via formulas.

Anytime you receive an asset, enter it in the “Obtained” section of the asset sheet Sheet.  Each individual acquisition is its own line.

“Tax Lot ID” is basically a serial number for that acquisition.  You use this number when tracking disposals to signify which lot you are disposing from.

“Date” is the date you acquired the asset.

“Acquisition Type” is a selection of categories of how you obtained the asset.  Different methods of acquisition affect how an asset is taxed on acquisition, disposition, or both.  The categories are as follows:

“Bought” – The asset was purchased or swapped for.  Exchange purchases and DEX swaps.
“Received” – The asset was given to you.  Someone donated it to you, sent it to you as payment for a good or service you provided, or you received it as interest for centralized “staking”.  For Rocket Pool Node Operators, Priority Fees, Smoothing Pool Rewards, and MEV likely fall under this category.
“Created” – Any asset that you create by virtue of running mining or staking software.  As in, before you were rewarded it, it didn’t exist.  Attestations, block rewards, and sync committees likely fall under this category.
“Created (Jarrett Method)” – The same as above but using the Jarrett Method of tax reporting.  Make sure you understand the potential legal risks if classifying acquisitions this way.

“Quantity” is the total amount acquired.

“Total Price” is the total price, including any fees, it cost to acquire the asset, in USD.  If you used crypto to purchase this asset, you must use the USD value when purchased.

“Cost Basis per Coin” is the cost basis per unit.  This is sometimes important for tax forms.

“Lot Remaining” is how much of that particular lot you have left.  When tracking disposals, you must manually enter in which lot and how much of it you are disposing from.  “Lot Remaining” should never be a negative number; if it is, go back to your disposal entry and make sure you don’t dispose too much from this lot.

“Income Tax Owed”, some acquisitions of crypto trigger an income tax responsibility as soon you receive it.  If so, the taxable amount is displayed here.

“Notes”, for any notes you may have about that particular tax lot.  Typically, it’s used for the source of that tax lot.

“Disposition ID” is basically a serial number used for that disposition.

“Date” is the date of your disposition.

“Quantity Disposed” is the amount disposed.  Of note, if your disposition is larger than one particular tax lot, you must break it up into separate dispositions.  This is because part of the disposition will need to be disposed from a different tax lot with a different date and cost basis.

“Total Disposal Price” is the total price, including any fees, it cost to dispose of the asset, in USD.  If you are disposing of this asset to purchase another crypto (like a swap), you must use the USD value at the time of the disposal/swap.

“Price per Coin at Disposition” is the price per unit at time of disposition.  This is sometimes important for tax forms.

“Lot Disposed From” is where you enter in the “Tax Lot ID” from the tax lot you want to dispose from.  Again, a disposal can’t be more than what is remaining in the tax lot.  If it is, you must manually break it up into separate disposals.

“Capital Term”, if applicable, displays whether your capital transaction was short term or long term.

“Capital Gain or Loss”, if applicable, displays your capital gain or loss.

“Taxed Income”, if applicable, displays and income that is now taxable because of your disposition.

“Notes” is a section for notes about your disposition, usually where or why you disposed of that asset.

The tax section displays the short term and long term capital gains or losses and the income tax owed, all by quarter.  To change the year, change the date.
